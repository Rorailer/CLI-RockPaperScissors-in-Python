# CLI-RockPaperScissors-in-Python
This is a project I did just for learning and better understanding python.
It is a **simple Rock, Papper and Scissors game**.
This game can also keep score of your Wins, Losses and Draws.
### If the score of any one of Wins, Losses or Draws goes above 9 the game will start to mess up the score.
